# STATIC

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your static assets.
Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/public/`.
Thus you'd want to delete this README.md before deploying to production.

Example: `/static/js/libraries.js` is mapped as `/public/js/libraries.js`.
